<h2>Reinvention of the Boiron Academy educational platform for health professionals and retail partners of Boiron Canada</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Training in the world of natural health and homeopathy is in great demand in Quebec and health professionals wishing to learn more sometimes lack tools and references. </strong><strong>Since the fall of 2019, <a href="http://rougeonblue.com">Rouge On Blue</a>&#8216;s experts have been working on a daily basis and in a co-creative way with the reference brand in homeopathy, <a href="http://boiron.ca">Boiron Canada</a> for all types of small and large scale digital marketing projects.</strong></p>
<p>Among the projects for this spring 2022, <a href="http://rougeonblue.com">Rouge On Blue</a> experts have been mandated to carry out a complete reinvention of the e-learning platform called the <a href="http://learn.boiron.ca">Boiron Academy</a>, designed to educate and assist retailers and health professionals in continuously improving their understanding of homeopathy in order to better serve <a href="http://boiron.ca">Boiron Canada</a> customers.</p>
<p>In co-creation with <a href="http://boiron.ca">Boiron Canada</a>&#8216;s marketing team, the mandate required the mobilization of various expertises of our team given that the original platform was outdated in every respect.</p>
<p>The mandate, under the creative direction of Sébastien Guy, was articulated in several steps ranging from the ergonomic redesign, simplification and improvement of the user experience (UX/UI); the complete visual redesign of all areas of the platform (homepage, courses, lessons, quizzes, the connected space, etc.) and finally a complete technological overhaul of the back end which clearly needed to be reprogrammed for better overall performance of the platform.<br />
We are proud to have created, programmed and optimized this platform, which is so essential for Boiron Canada&#8217;s partners, whether they are pharmacy retailers, specialized stores or health professionals with whom the reference company in homeopathy deals.</p>

<h4><strong><a href="http://groupex.coop">Groupex</a> is a horticulture cooperative that brings together a vast network of independent garden centres and landscaping businesses from Québec, New Brunswick and Ontario. As a powerful buying group, members can benefit from significant competitive advantages in the horticulture and landscaping sectors. Operating throughout Quebec for over 35 years, <a href="http://groupex.coop">the cooperative</a> has built a solid reputation throughout the province and currently deals with over 120 members and 150 passionate and exciting suppliers.</strong></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3489" src="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-cottonbro-4507738-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="640" srcset="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-cottonbro-4507738-200x300.jpg 200w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-cottonbro-4507738-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-cottonbro-4507738-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-cottonbro-4507738-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-cottonbro-4507738-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-cottonbro-4507738-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" />The last few years have been particularly marked by unprecedented growth due to the upheaval in the lifestyles of individuals who have begun to develop new habits and lifestyles, notably through telecommuting. Indeed, the interest in taking care of one&#8217;s home has grown significantly in recent years and people have discovered new passions for gardening, interior and exterior design.</p>
<p>This beautiful growth obviously comes with its advantages but also its challenges!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.groupex.coop/en/">The cooperative</a> has become aware of a growing need for digital transformation, particularly with regard to its business processes and work tools. Indeed, technologies have evolved and continue to evolve and the company felt the need to equip itself properly to be at the forefront of its industry. With this in mind, <a href="https://www.groupex.coop/en/">Groupex</a> selected the experts at <a href="http://rougeonblue.ca">Rouge On Blue</a> for this large-scale project.</p>
<p>Since December 2021, the entire <a href="http://rougeonblue.com">Rouge On Blue</a> team has been mobilized to provide strategic support for the digital transformation of the Groupex horticultural cooperative. This long-term project, which is one of <a href="http://rougeonblue.ca">our agency</a>&#8216;s key areas of expertise, has been articulated around 3 major strategic phases and is coming to an end in the summer of 2022.</p>
<p>Indeed, the objective of the digital transformation is based on a long-term reflection and strategic planning of the cooperative. Our experts asked themselves the following question: what is <a href="http://Groupex">the cooperative</a>&#8216;s business model for 2030 and how can it significantly increase member satisfaction and the efficiency of operations and services offered?</p>
<p data-wp-editing="1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3492" src="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-ketut-subiyanto-4132363-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="640" srcset="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-ketut-subiyanto-4132363-200x300.jpg 200w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-ketut-subiyanto-4132363-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-ketut-subiyanto-4132363-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-ketut-subiyanto-4132363-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-ketut-subiyanto-4132363-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-ketut-subiyanto-4132363-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" />To answer this fundamental question, our team of analysts conducted a state of the art analysis of the existing customer experience by doing a 360° analysis of the cooperative: internal environment, external environment, current business model, but also the best practices and 2022 trends of the industry in which it operates. More than twenty in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with various stakeholders: employees, members and suppliers and very strong insights resulted.</p>
<p>After 3 months of research and in light of all these analyses, our experts were able to develop a clear picture of the current digital maturity of <a href="http://groupex.coop">the cooperative</a> but also of the wishes of each stakeholder for the future.<br />
Following this, during the subsequent phases, our experts focused on developing a vision of<a href="http://groupex.coop"> the cooperative</a>&#8216;s future in an integrated manner. Indeed, various strategic reflection workshops were held with the objective of identifying the key and priority projects to achieve the desired digital transformation at Groupex based on the various discoveries of phase 1. More than 35 projects were identified, evaluated, estimated and organized according to a 5-year roadmap.<br />
Finally, to instill the vision of the future of Groupex that resulted from all these months of work and to inspire the various stakeholders, we developed an interactive presentation in co-creation with the Groupex executive to demonstrate what the cooperative of the future has to offer its members.<br />
To say the least, we can&#8217;t wait to see these seeds germinate and bear fruit!</p>

<h2>Sometimes with design, as in life, less is more. Minimalism in design is not about removing all elements, it&#8217;s about keeping only the elements you need. Sounds easy enough, right?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The human mind aspires to minimalism.</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular culture conditioning, our brains are not extraordinary machines with superhuman processing powers. The ease with which our little minds can be overwhelmed by sensory overload is a bit embarrassing, to be honest. The fact is, our minds can&#8217;t process information dumps.</p>
<p>We break down the information we receive into smaller pieces, look for patterns and develop associations that help us make sense of the data. If we were to describe minimalism in a short, single sentence, we would say that its design is created with a distinct intention. What is your graphic design work trying to accomplish? What is its singular purpose? What is the point of it?</p>
<p>It forces you to find that purpose of being and challenges you to pare down the design and get rid of all the flashy details until only that purpose remains. But before you confuse minimalism with simplicity, know that minimal design is not naked. It is richer and more meaningful than any other graphic design style.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Simple against minimal 🤷‍♀️</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3259 size-full" src="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pearll_mobile2.png" alt="" width="1920" height="782" srcset="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pearll_mobile2.png 1920w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pearll_mobile2-300x122.png 300w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pearll_mobile2-1024x417.png 1024w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pearll_mobile2-768x313.png 768w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pearll_mobile2-1536x626.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Minimal design is <strong>very utilitarian:</strong> we focus only on the essentials and get rid of the fluff. In other words, while minimal design is simple, the goal is not to create simple shapes or obvious designs.</p>
<p>Instead, it can be complex, colorful and<strong> full of character.</strong></p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<p>A minimalist design doesn&#8217;t have to be colorless &#8211; you just have to choose <strong>fewer colors</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be complex, but never overwhelming.</li>
<li>It can abandon flat design, but with a purpose.</li>
<li>The latter is important to remember.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the two styles certainly overlap, a minimal design can exist without being flat. It can have shadows, a 3D effect and color gradients.</p>
<p>Your only goal is to use these elements if they are essential to the design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Like any other type of digital design, minimalism has a few attributes that make it what it is.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>It&#8217;s light<a href="https://marketsplash.com/minimalism-in-graphic-design/#link6">💡</a></strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2925 size-full" src="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Website.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1062" srcset="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Website.png 1920w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Website-300x166.png 300w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Website-1024x566.png 1024w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Website-768x425.png 768w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Website-1536x850.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get bogged down in unnecessary details, minimal design<strong> conserves resource</strong>s and uses only what is necessary.</p>
<p>Think of the Apple logo for a moment.</p>
<p>An organic shape in a single solid color with no font carrying the brand name. With nothing else cluttering the logo, you have the time and focus to <strong>appreciate its beauty.</strong></p>
<p>But graphic design is not limited to brand identity work.</p>
<p>So, as a graphic designer, you must follow the rules of minimalism <strong>in everything you create.</strong> Whether it&#8217;s information on your website, copy on your landing page or images in your inventory, you should <strong>only use what&#8217;s necessary a</strong>nd get rid of clutter.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>It&#8217;s useful ☝️</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2875 size-full" src="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moon_by_simaudio_website.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1062" srcset="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moon_by_simaudio_website.png 1920w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moon_by_simaudio_website-300x166.png 300w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moon_by_simaudio_website-1024x566.png 1024w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moon_by_simaudio_website-768x425.png 768w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moon_by_simaudio_website-1536x850.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>For example, when you look at the landing page below, you immediately see the <strong>hero images</strong>. Zero things on this page that shouldn&#8217;t be there. Each piece of information on the page<strong> answers a certain query.</strong></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>It&#8217;s timeless⏳</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2990 size-full" src="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Be_4.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1138" srcset="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Be_4.png 1920w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Be_4-300x178.png 300w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Be_4-1024x607.png 1024w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Be_4-768x455.png 768w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Be_4-1536x910.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Good graphic design should be <strong>timeless.</strong></p>
<p>You want your brand logo and website design, etc. to<strong> remain relevant</strong> and understandable when all the latest design fads have passed.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>It supports the visual hierarchy🙌</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2965 size-full" src="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mobile4.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1062" srcset="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mobile4.png 1920w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mobile4-300x166.png 300w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mobile4-1024x566.png 1024w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mobile4-768x425.png 768w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mobile4-1536x850.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Visual hierarchy is the process of presenting information in <strong>order of importance</strong>. Minimalist design, being a <strong>focused approach</strong>, follows the commands of the visual hierarchy to a T.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>It ameliorates balance ⚖️</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2907 size-full" src="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maquette_chalet_zenya.png" alt="" width="1922" height="1107" srcset="https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maquette_chalet_zenya.png 1922w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maquette_chalet_zenya-300x173.png 300w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maquette_chalet_zenya-1024x590.png 1024w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maquette_chalet_zenya-768x442.png 768w, https://rougeonblue.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maquette_chalet_zenya-1536x885.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px" /></p>
<p>One of the many reasons the human brain is obsessed with minimalism is the way it introduces b<strong>alance and calm</strong> wherever it goes.</p>
<p>Just as you can get sensory overload from too much noise, highly detailed graphic design work can also feel claustrophobic.</p>
<h2></h2>

<p>White space and minimalism are interrelated concepts.</p>
<p>While minimalist graphic design focuses on <strong>highlighting the hero&#8217;s functionality</strong> without the distracting details, the use of white space helps bring the hero&#8217;s element into even greater focus and devours unnecessary details.</p>
<p>It replaces them with a solid, calm background that further emphasizes the<strong> main element.</strong></p>
<p>However, providing support for the hero element is not the only service white space provides. It is also used to amplify the <strong>brand message and design intent</strong> by creatively enhancing the surrounding space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Reflector Entertainment has unveiled the trailer for the studio&#8217;s first video game, Unknown 9: Awakening.</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The game represents the main hub of a much larger ecosystem of content being built around the ambitious Unknown 9 narrative universe. The studio invites fans to dive into the world of Unknown 9, with a first look at the new <a href="https://youtu.be/DUbFeNDI_FI">video game trailer.</a> </strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Led by an experienced and diverse development team, Reflector has created an all-new narrative universe and is officially unveiling it this month. The team is proud to present <strong>Unknown 9: Awakening</strong>, a narrative-driven third-person action-adventure game with a first look at its protagonist, Haroona, and a glimpse of her abilities in the &#8220;Reverse,&#8221; an unexplored dimension of our world.</p>
<p>Raised on the streets of Calcutta, India and haunted by visions of her own death, Haroona struggles to understand her mysterious innate abilities to manipulate the invisible. A mentor soon helps Haroona hone her gifts, teaches her how to access the mysterious hidden dimension known as &#8220;The Reverse&#8221;, and propels her on a journey to unlock the mysteries of this new realm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Unknown 9: Awakening</strong> is Reflector&#8217;s very first reveal. It&#8217;s a passion project undertaken by a small team of industry veterans who want to do things differently,&#8221; says Alexandre Amancio, CEO of Reflector Entertainment. &#8220;Our game features a complex heroine who must accept who she is. The game is set in the Unknown 9 universe, a modern narrative universe that focuses on humanity being on the edge of transcendence or self-destruction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The larger <strong>Unknown 9</strong> universe features interconnected media and content offerings with intersecting characters and storylines that form a rich and immersive narrative universe &#8211; including a mystery novel by best-selling author Layton Green called <strong>Unknown 9: Genesis,</strong> an original podcast called <strong>Unknown 9: Out of Sight,</strong> and a comic book, <strong>Unknown 9: Tormen</strong>t. These different experiences are all stand-alone products (comic book, novel, immersive experience, novel, etc.), but when experienced as a whole, they form a larger narrative and lead to a greater appreciation of the mysterious Unknown 9 universe.</p>

<p>Rouge On Blue is an alliance of talents equally committed to a transdisciplinary approach to communication. The company shapes each brand as an original work of art. This expertise relies on an immersive digital and storytelling culture to meet all the challenges of organizations. From brand strategy to marketing deployment to the design of unusual or unconventional experiences: doing what has never been done is their ultimate passion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<hr />
<h3>It is with great pride that the talents of Rouge On Blue have participated in the Unknown 9 transmedia project over the past 18 months. The first challenge was to position this new universe in the relatively saturated North American entertainment industry.</h3>
<p>Believe in the unknown&#8221; quickly became the brand&#8217;s new promise, titled in French &#8220;plongez dans l&#8217;Unknown&#8221;. Multiple strategic projects were then defined by André Vu and Lionel Pardin to ensure a completely original marketing of the Unknown 9 universe, notably at SXSW in Texas and globally.</p>
<p>The marketing projects were orchestrated and delivered concomitantly by Reflector&#8217;s creative and marketing teams and all the specialists of the Rouge On Blue collective.</p>
<p>One of these key projects quickly brought the heroes of the new Unknown 9 world to life in original photography by selecting key actors and models in Quebec. The photography was co-created by Christian Tremblay and Jeremy Henrard, with creative direction from Sébastien Guy for all marketing projects. This co-creation with the Reflector team also materialized in the original design of the future Unknown9.com platform. Finally, a 360 campaign based on the power and originality of new media was developed while respecting the brand&#8217;s foundations, originality and strength.</p>
<p>Reflector&#8217;s marketing team, orchestrated by Noémie de Rothschild, Jérémy Leith, Elena Cesare and their colleagues, ensured the success of the communications.</p>

<p>Various Rouge On Blue specialists were involved throughout these creative developments, including Hala Tazi, Thomas Nelligan, Mélanie Franz, Christian Desrosiers, Pierre-Bernard Dow Blanchet, Marco Gervasio, Benoit Lapointe, Benoit Sicotte, Marc-André Rioux, Luc Normandin, Stéphane Hoareau, François Beauregard, Charlotte Trudeau, Nader Aboukheir, etc. We note the successful development of a mysterious Unknown 9 box intended for influencers and an unusual interactive event concept that symbolizes the &#8220;other&#8221; world that is very present in the multi-narrative story.</p>

<p>The first phase, which begins on October 24, 2019, will focus on different variations of the Montreal skyline in reference to the panorama and the breathtaking views that visitors will be able to admire from the future Observatory which will culminate at the summit of the Oratory. The skies will change on animated digital signage, highlighting the light of day, a sunset and a night sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a context where Quebeckers are solicited by many charitable causes, the challenge was significant in order to be able to stand out. We had to succeed in conveying the right message and touching both the emotion and the imagination by detaching ourselves from the strictly religious character of the place, since the Oratory is also an emblem of the heritage that shines Montréal by hosting more than 2 million of visitors from around the world annually, &#8220;says Céline Barbeau, Director of Communications Services at the Oratory.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new observatory in the dome lantern will be the highest point of view of the city, at 360 o. It is in this perspective that the visual campaign took shape, highlighting this breathtaking view of the sky. So we bet on familiar expressions that are used in everyday life, with the sky in reference. We join a large audience, regardless of the beliefs of each, &#8220;said Lionel Pardin, president and strategist of Red On Blue.</p>
<p>The website will allow visitors to share their attachment to the Oratory, learn more about the great development project and make donations.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><a href="https://simaudio.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOON by Simaudio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with whom we collaborate throughout the year, continues to thrive in its quest for sound purity. This year, the leading manufacturer of high-fidelity sound systems is using its expertise and its 39 years of experience to launch a new sensational digital campaign called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Elevate your sound experience&#8221;.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The campaign has just been launched and will last for 3 months. The wind of freshness that it brings is, to say the least,  tremendously transcendent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our specialists </span><a href="https://rougeonblue.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouge On Blue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the team of experts of</span><a href="https://simaudio.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MOON by Simaudio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aspire to bring a new breath to the various media platforms of </span><a href="https://simaudio.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a digital campaign based on the emotions conveyed through sound and the exaltation of the senses; for which music exists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We then focused our artistic direction on 3 personalities invented and imagined in order to arouse the interest of </span><a href="https://simaudio.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOON </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">customers but also in the spirit of acquiring new ones, having already shown enthusiasm for high fidelity music. . From May to July, many inspiring visuals and creatives will be featured on</span><a href="https://simaudio.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MOON&#8217;s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and social media, along with inspiring content and tips and tricks to enhance your sound experience. Launched during the week of the </span><a href="https://www.highendsociety.de/index.php/en/home.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-End Festival in Munich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is with the feels of the campaign &#8220;Elevate your sound experience&#8221; that MOON proudly presents the last novelties of this year. Many surprises will be in the spotlight during the next three months and we strongly invite you to stay tuned!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://rougeonblue.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouge on Blue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is always a real pride to count</span><a href="https://simaudio.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MOON by Simaudio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a business partner and it is with passion and dedication that we imagined and deployed this brand new campaign together.</span></p>
